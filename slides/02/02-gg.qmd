```

### Narrative

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.

Represent each observation with a point and map species to the color of each point.

Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.

Finally, use a discrete color scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of color blindness.
